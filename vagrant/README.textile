h1. Vagrant

Vagrant is used to create VirtualBox machines automatically and provision them with Puppet.

Installation:

bc. # gem install vagrant veewee

h2. Basebox

Veewee is used once to create a 'debian64' box, so that Vagrant is able to use it for machines.

bc. # Build Debian 64 "empty box"
vagrant basebox build 'debian64'
vagrant basebox export 'debian64'

bc. # Add it to Vagrant
vagrant box add debian64 debian64.box

h2. Vagrant

bc. vagrant up # creates the maching and provisions it
vagrant provision # re-run Puppet provisioning
vagrant reload # recreate (useful to refersh ports / mount points)
vagrant suspend # suspend the machine
vagrant resume # resume the machine
vagrant destroy # destroy machine completely
